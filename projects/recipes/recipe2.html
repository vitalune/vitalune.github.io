		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>There's nothing better than winding down after a long day with a warm, satisfying snack- that doesn't leave you feeling guilty or bloated. One evening, I felt as though I had not eaten enough throughout the day, and was on the hunt for something that could satisfy my sweet tooth. At the same time, I remained mindful of my nutrition goals, so I wouldn't allow myself to eat anything too unhealthy. I didn't want the usual sugary desserts, and a heavy meal was out of the question.</p>
		<p>As I browsed through my pantry, I realized I had the perfect ingredients to create a bowl of cinnamon apple oats. The result? A nutritious late-night treat that feels like a big hug.</p>

                            <li>1/2 scoop cinnamon-flavored whey protein powder</li>

                            <li>In a small bowl, add the oats and the milk- enough so that the oats are singularly floating around in the bowl like cereal.</li>
                            <li>Put the bowl in the microwave and heat it for about 50 seconds.</li>
                            <li>Take it out of the microwave, then add the protein powder. The whey should mix harmoniously with the milky oats, and give them life.</li>
                            <li>In a seperate plate, slice your apple and banana, and heat them for about 10 seconds in the microwave.</li>
                            <li>Add the sliced fruits on top of the oats, along with a sprinkle of cinnamon, and a drizzle of honey. Enjoy!</li>

        <h3>Tips & Tricks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Substitute another type of milk rather than whole if you wish.</li>
            <li>Use a sweet apple variety (e.g., Fuji or Gala) for a natural sweetness.</li>
            <li>If you donâ€™t have protein powder, substitute it with a tablespoon of almond butter or Greek yogurt for added protein.</li>
            <li>Add a handful of chopped nuts or seeds for extra crunch and healthy fats.</li>
        </ul>
