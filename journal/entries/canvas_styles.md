# Canvas Custom Styles - an ongoing project.

## Description

For this project, I decided to write a CSS document that overrides the existing styling of Canvas's dashboard. I did this by:

1. Opening the source code of the Canvas Dashboard
2. Sourcing through every element in the code to find which ones I wanted to restyle
3. Wrote CSS code correspondent to the desired elements, and wrote my changes.

These changes include fonts, colors, and sizing of several elements.

[CSS Styles file](Canvas_styles.css)
