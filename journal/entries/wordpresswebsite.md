# Tank Cafe

## My WordPress Website: [Tank Cafe](https://tankcafe8.wordpress.com/)

### Three Coffee Shops Whose Websites I Studied:

1. [Founders Coffee](https://founderscoffeeco.com/)

2. [Maman](https://mamannyc.com/locations/georgetown)

3. [Misha's](https://mishascoffee.com/)

### My Reflection

A common theme that all three of these coffee shops share are their calm, chill nature. A noteworthy fact is that two out of three of these coffee shops are the most popular in their area, which is what led to me embracing the chill, calm nature of my coffee shop. Also, all three coffee shops included a heartwarming "About us" or "Our story" section in order to appeal to customers more through means of emotional connection- thus, I did the same. Not only did I add an "About Us" section, but also a "Why Tank Cafe" section, filled with pathos and emotion in order to manipulate kindhearted prospective customers to buy coffee. With all that being said, the website that I found most inspiration from is Founders Coffee (due to some bias as I worked there.) The main aspect of their website that I employed onto mine is the hook- a beautiful, huge picture of a product that easily captures the customers' attention.

My personal experience working with Wordpress was subpar. Throughout my project, I kept feeling stumped in regards to the non-user friendly interface, which kept acting as a barrier between me and what I wanted to put on the website. For example, there were many instances where I simply could not edit a block of text or format due to the template that I'm using. I presume that this is mainly because I'm on the free version of wordpress, but it was still mildly annoying. The major positive conclusion that I made from working with wordpress is that I'm very appreciative of not having to worry about the back-end of the website, as Wordpress takes care of it for me. Thus, I was able to focus on creating new pages and content, and Wordpress would understand where to insert the newly created page/content in respect to my chosen website template.
