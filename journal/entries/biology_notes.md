## Glycolysis

Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm and involves the breakdown of one molecule of glucose $(C6H12O6)$ into two molecules of pyruvate $(C3H3O3)$. The net products are 2 ATP molecules, 2 NADH molecules, and 2 pyruvate molecules. The steps of glycolysis are as follows:

### 1. Phosphorylation

* ATP gets hydrolyzed, losing a phosphate and converting to ADP

$ATP + H2O \to ADP + P_i + energy$

* Glucose backbone receives phosphate, raising its energy; becoming destabilized and splitting into two 3-carbon molecules (triose phosphate)

$C6 + P_i \to$ Glucose 6-phosphate + Fructose 6-phosphate

### 2. Oxidative Phosphorylation & NADH Formation

* Triose phosphate is  oxidized, losing a hydrogen atom and electron particle, which gets received by $NAD^+$, reducing it to NADH

$C3H2P2$ - $H2$ 

* Triose phosphates also lose a phosphate each, which are received by the ADP, forming ATP

$ADP + P_i \to ATP$

(This is extremely oversimplified and almost incorrect due to the fact)

## Steps of Cellular Respiration

| Process | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Glycolysis | Glucose, 2 ATP, 2 $NAD^+$ | 4 ATP, 2 NADH, 2 pyruvate |
| Krebs Cycle | acetyl CoA, $NAD^+$, ADP | NADH, $FADH_{2}$, $CO_{2}$, ATP |
| Electron Transport Chain | NADH, $FADH_{2}$, $H^+$, $O_{2}$ | $NAD^+$, ATP, $H_{2}O$ |
| ATP Synthase | ADP, $P_i$ | ATP |
