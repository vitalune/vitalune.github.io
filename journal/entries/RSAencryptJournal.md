* What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?
  
Symmetric encryption uses one key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses
a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private (secret) key for decryption.

* Explain the steps of the encryption and decryption process.
  
In asymmetric encryption, the sender encrypts the message using the recipient's public key. The recipient
then decrypts the message using their private key, ensuring that only they can access the original content.

* Why is it important that you never share your private key?
  
The private key is used to decrypt messages that are meant for only you. If shared, anyone could decrypt
your messages, compromising confidentiality and security.
